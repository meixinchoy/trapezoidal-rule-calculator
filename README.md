Simple javascript trapezoidal rule web calculator

Use this online trapezoidal rule calculator to find the approximate value of integration. Just enter the equation, lower limit, upper limit and the number of step size to get the results. This calculator is also designed to handle lower and upper limits with negative values.

### Trapezoidal Rule
In Numerical Methods, the [Trapezoidal Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule) works by approximating the region under the graph of the function f(x) as a trapezoid and calculating its area. The trapezoidal rule may be viewed as the result obtained by averaging the left and right Riemann sums. The integral can be even better approximated by partitioning the integration interval, applying the trapezoidal rule to each subinterval, and summing the results.
